What to do next?

I could make a hand replayer:
-- Layout players in a circle, roughly.
-- Press some key to "step" to next action or board card(s).
-- Maybe try layout out players not in a circle (in a line instead).

I could calculate EV given knowledge of cards.
-- Would need to figure out how to calculate odds.

Let's make a replayer. What medium? curses? Native OSX? Web?

This could be my EmberTime project!
